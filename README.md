CoroutineDispatcher isn't available for a target platform. <br/><br/>

### Repository

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://repo.repsy.io/mvn/chrynan/public" }
}
```

### Dependencies

```groovy
implementation "com.chrynan.dispatchers:dispatchers:$VERSION"
```

## Usage üë®‚Äçüíª

This library provides a `Dispatchers.IO` property in the common source set. Simply use that, or if needed, you can
access all the `CoroutineDispatchers` via the `dispatchers` top-level object. Then use the available dispatchers:

```kotlin
launch(dispatchers.main) {
    withContext(dispatchers.io) { ... }
    withContext(dispatchers.default) { ... }
    withContext(dispatchers.unconfined) { ... }
    withContext(dispatchers.ui) { ... }
}
```

Since `CoroutineDispatchers` is an interface, it is easy to create an implementation or mock the component for testing
purposes.
